            <p class="anno">Talks about three main ways in which immigration and crime rates are related and goes into detail on policies that can hurt or defend immigrants. The first of these ways is that the crime rate significantly increases when immigration rates also increase. In order to solve this, one must either limit immigration or start deportations. The second way is that sometimes those foreigners have different cultures and understandings, which could mean that their temptations are different. Therefore, there must be crime prevention programs to remedy this. And the last one is that it is necessary to have a program in place to ensure foreign-born people have the same access as domestic-born people in terms of getting justice.</p>

ProQuest, https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/escalating-war-on-immigrants-is-public-health/docview/3232513760/se-2.</span>
            <p class="anno">The authors question the claim that the anti-immigration policies can protect public health. They believe these policies will force people to hide underground, which will harm public health. Moreover, Western policymakers will blame all the medical pressure on immigration, so the government will deliberately abandon those undocumented populations. Then, the authors use research on public health and immigration mental health to prove that “the U.S. public health system’s failure to protect immigrants is a failure of its own mission.”</p>

            <p class="anno">This article is about a congressional hearing in 1919 regarding H.R. 13965, a bill proposed by the Department of Justice to deport “undesired aliens.” Alfred Bettman, a representative from the Department of Justice, spoke before the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization. The two groups of immigrants who were targeted by this bill were those who were interned during World War 1 and those who were convicted of crimes against U.S. law during the period of war. The House committee held concern over the wording of the bill, which would allow the Justice Department to deport anyone convicted of “any offense,” which was seemingly broad and could allow for deportations of those who did not commit crimes that harmed national security. Overall, I can use this congressional report to help guide me through the proposed and existing policies regarding deportations at the time of 1919. Something particularly interesting is the portion that allows the DOJ to deport detained immigrants for “any offense,” which seems similar to the dataset we chose, which had seemingly odd reasons for deporting immigrants in the United States. There may be many parallels between the dataset and existing policies.</p>

            <p class="anno">Golash-Boza links mass deportation to global capitalism and labor control. She shows how immigration enforcement targets racialized workers to maintain economic inequality. This source adds an economic and sociological view to our research on deportation systems. It’s concise, analytical, and fits our project’s focus on social impacts.</p>

            <p class="anno">Although it mainly focuses on the Second Amendment law, Gulasekaram’s article looks closely at the historical and legal status of non-citizens and their constitutional rights, including who counts as part of “the people” protected by the law. The article argues that non-citizens have often been treated as a marginal group, with rights that can be limited or taken away, especially during times of strict immigration enforcement. Gulasekaram shows how the courts and Congress created a clear distinction between citizen rights and non-citizen privileges, which left non-citizens vulnerable to actions such as mass deportation. This article is useful for the research as it explains why these deportations were so disruptive. Non-citizens had fewer legal protections, which made it hard for communities to resist.</p>

            <p class="anno">Hernandez traces the U.S. Border Patrol’s origins and shows how race and politics influenced immigration enforcement. She argues that deportation practices were rooted in racial discrimination. This source gives valuable historical context for our project on deportation policy and enforcement culture. The book is comprehensive but focuses mainly on the U.S.–Mexico border.</p>

            <p class="anno">Hernandez looks at the history of anti-Mexican sentiment and organized expulsions, mostly in the 19th century, and connects them to later 20th and 21st century deportation practices. This article argues that these repeated expulsions created a “historical memory” of vulnerability for Mexican American communities. By focusing on regional expulsions that happened before federal deportations were fully enforced in 1892–1921, Hernandez shows how these communities were already traumatized and wary of authorities. This history shaped collective identity and fostered deep distrust of the government. The article is helpful in understanding the impact on Mexican immigrant communities around the period of our research question. It shows how people were displaced and how communities organized under policies of the federal government.</p>

            <span class="cite">Kellor, Frances A. “Needed—A Domestic Immigration Policy.” <em>The North American Review</em>, vol. 193, no. 4, 1911, p. 561. ProQuest, https://www.proquest.com/magazines/needed-domestic-immigration-policy/docview/1296780319/se-2.</span>
            <p class="anno">This article explains the need for a reformed immigration policy for the United States. The goal of this new policy was to mitigate the negative effects of existing legislation at the time the article was published. Kellor also examines the Federal Immigration Commission’s report in 1911 and argues that the government has failed to help immigrants assimilate into their communities through a lack of education and resources. Kellor proposes that a reorganization of policy would be as follows: distribution, protection, and education. Distribution would direct immigrants to jobs and land, protection would safeguard immigrants from those looking to take advantage of them, and education would help them learn English and learn their rights to assimilate more easily. Lastly, Kellor also touches upon deportations and how people were allowed to come to the U.S. only to be later deported, criticizing this system. Overall, I think this work will be very beneficial to my portion of the project because I can look at how the lack of resources affected immigrant communities in the United States and how deportations also harmed them. One interesting thing I can look at specifically is the journey immigrants took to reach the United States, only to later be deported and have their families broken apart. I think this would bring a humanistic perspective to the deportation data we look at.</p>

            <p class="anno">This article from the UCLA Library explains and analyzes how and why immigrants were deported from the United States between 1908 and 1986. The authors research historical data from immigration yearbooks to identify trends and patterns in deportation reasoning, showing a shift from criminal to paperwork or visa issues. King and Obinna argue that spikes in violent crime rates often coincide with increases in deportations, connecting that public fear and crime levels influence immigration enforcement. This article is beneficial to our research as it allows us to derive context and understanding behind the pure numerical data we already have. While the article provides great evidence, it should be more in-depth on how political ideals and media shaped deportation.</p>

            <span class="cite">Lauck, W. Jett. “The Significance of Recent Immigration.” <em>The North American Review</em>, vol. 195, no. 2, 1912, p. 201, https://search.library.ucla.edu/permalink/01UCS_LAL/192ecse/cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_1296792778.</span>
            <p class="anno">This article discusses the impact that recent immigration has had on the populations of U.S.-born citizens and older immigrants working in the United States. The author, Lauck, argues that recent immigration hasn’t been for religious, political, or economic reasons, but instead transportation companies bringing arrivals to work only for a short amount of time. Workers who came for this were paid lower wages, impacted working conditions for existing populations, and slowed the wages of U.S.-born citizens and older, working immigrants. Lastly, Lauck argues for increased legislation and measures to slow the expansion of immigration, namely by creating a literacy test and a head-tax to limit unskilled laborers from entering. Overall, I think this article is important because it provides insight into the other side of the issue of slowing immigration and tightening policy surrounding it. In addition, while the article does not specifically mention deportations, it’s important because it gives background information on the climate at the time and the justification for why some populations were targeted by different policies. This article is beneficial in contextualizing that the main reason for deportations was economic.</p>

JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2012.00470.x.</span>
            <p class="anno">This article explains how U.S. immigration laws after 1965 unintentionally increased long-term Latin American migration. Massey and Pren argue that restrictive policies made immigrants stay longer instead of returning home. It supports our project by showing how enforcement policies shaped migration trends. The data is credible but slightly dated for recent policy effects.</p>

            <p class="anno">This article looks closely at how deportation arrests developed in the US legal system in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Nash shows how these arrests were different from normal criminal arrests because they targeted non-citizens based on their status rather than any crime. The article goes through the laws, court decisions, and administrative systems that gave immigration agents broad, often unwarranted powers. This created a kind of parallel system of enforcement for immigrants, leaving them very vulnerable. It’s especially useful for our research since it explains the risks and instability immigrant communities faced between 1892 and 1921, showing how legal structures could directly affect deportation policy.</p>

ProQuest, https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/first-do-no-harm-why-anti-immigrant-policies/docview/2727899799/se-2. doi:10.1057/s41271-022-00364-8.</span>
            <p class="anno">Authors analyze the various effects made by policies. They connect the anti-immigration policies with the mental health issues of immigrant families and point out that these policies influence immigrants’ identity cognition, which hinders immigrants from getting mental health treatments and leads to greater health problems. Also, they find that this public health problem occurs globally. The authors want to find a credible way to solve this problem through their analysis. Thus, they point out three pieces of advice. First, the government can research and measure the relationship between immigration policies and public mental health mathematically, which helps them to oversee the effects of the policies. Second, the government can put more money into healthcare in anti-immigration areas. Third, the government can support the volunteer organizations or public services to act positively for undocumented populations.</p>

            <p class="anno">The author emphasizes that Congress has been making immigration policy changes since 1882 that have severely impacted immigration to the United States. The author splits it into four main categories: Restrictive, Protective, Distributive, and Administrative. However, the first and second are described to be more accurately called “restrictive and selective.” These policies encompass controlling the quality of immigrants rather than the quantity.</p>

            <p class="anno">This source is regarding U.S. immigration policy debates from the 18th century to the early 20th century. The author argues that debates about immigration in the U.S. repeat the same pros and cons over time. Each period brings back similar worries about jobs, culture, and national loyalty. Seller explains that these arguments are usually driven more by American fears, politics, and economic conditions than by the real actions of immigrants. In short, immigration policies often reflect what the country feels or fears at the time, not the actual facts about immigrants. This helps us find historical framing and context that helps us understand long-run enforcement trends like the DHS data. It focuses much on historical synthesis but dates to the early 1980s, is light on quantitative tests, and offers limited coverage of post-1965.</p>

            <p class="anno">This book has three topics. Firstly, the authors analyze how immigration and immigrants affect the art forms. Secondly, they focus on the minorities and the changes in the arts. Thirdly, they discuss the intersections between performance and social changes during immigration. In this book, the authors analyze the arts and American history to reveal Americans' responses to social change, immigration, urban life, and nationalism. This book is a resource for understanding the cultural conflicts during that time, which may help us understand the reasons behind the deportation policies.</p>

            <p class="anno">This data file displays the number of people removed or returned from the U.S. between 1892 and 2017. This displays the shift in severity of immigration enforcement while, in addition, shifting from voluntary returns to formal removals over time. The source or author is the U.S government, where they show changing policies and enforcement practices. This connects to the research question related to deportation trends, aligning with similar readings, providing context behind these shifting rates. While the data is reliable and useful for long-term analysis, it lacks an explanation for year-to-year changes and omits demographic details.</p>

            <p class="anno">This article talks about “The New Immigration Act” and breaks it down section by section. This act passed in February of 1907 and was through the Conference Committee between the House and the Senate. Section 1 act one depicts raising head-money from $2 to $4 to protect the immigrants by giving more funding for adequate accommodations. While section two talks about how many immigrants who are deemed "imbecile" will now be equally treated as citizens who are deemed “imbecile”. This is due to the fact that neither party will contribute and therefore should be treated the same. This section also adds a physical test for “aliens”. The rest of the article continues to outline the sections.</p>
